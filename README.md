# 🎓 BlockVote - Learn JavaScript & Web3 by Building

Welcome to BlockVote! This is a hands-on learning project where you'll build a complete blockchain voting application while mastering JavaScript and Web3 development.

## 🌟 What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have created a fully functional decentralized voting application that:
- ✅ Connects to MetaMask wallet
- ✅ Displays voting options with real-time results
- ✅ Handles blockchain transactions
- ✅ Shows professional UI with loading states
- ✅ Provides transparency through blockchain verification

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] MetaMask browser extension installed
- [ ] Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- [ ] Basic understanding of HTML/CSS (we'll teach JavaScript!)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install MetaMask**
   - Go to [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
   - Install the browser extension
   - Create a new wallet (save your seed phrase safely!)

2. **Switch to Test Network**
   - Open MetaMask
   - Click network dropdown → "Show test networks"
   - Select "Sepolia test network"

3. **Get Test ETH**
   - Visit [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com)
   - Enter your wallet address
   - Request test ETH (needed for transactions)

4. **Start Local Server**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Option 2: Node.js
   npx http-server
   
   # Then open: http://localhost:8000
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Your Progress

### Module 1 Validation
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
validateModule1();

// This will check:
// ✅ AppState object created
// ✅ formatWalletAddress working
// ✅ calculateTotalVotes working
// ✅ DOM manipulation functions
```

### Module 3 Validation
```javascript
// Test Web3 integration:
validateModule3();

// Then test wallet connection:
connectWallet();
```

## 🎯 Module 1: Getting Started

### Exercise 1.1: Application State
Open `scripts/app.js` and find TODO 1.1. Create the AppState object:

```javascript
const AppState = {
    isWalletConnected: false,
    currentAccount: null,
    currentNetwork: null,
    selectedOption: null,
    hasUserVoted: false,
    pollTitle: "What's your favorite programming language?",
    pollOptions: [
        { id: 0, name: "JavaScript", votes: 0 },
        { id: 1, name: "Python", votes: 0 },
        { id: 2, name: "Solidity", votes: 0 },
        { id: 3, name: "Rust", votes: 0 }
    ]
};
```

### Exercise 1.2: Utility Functions
Complete the `formatWalletAddress` function:

```javascript
function formatWalletAddress(address) {
    if (!address) return 'Not Connected';
    return `${address.substring(0, 6)}...${address.substring(address.length - 4)}`;
}
```

### Test Your Work
```javascript
// Run in browser console:
console.log('Poll Title:', AppState.pollTitle);
console.log('Formatted Address:', formatWalletAddress('0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678'));
validateModule1(); // Should pass all tests!
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"AppState is not defined"**
- Complete TODO 1.1 in `scripts/app.js`
- Make sure you've defined all required properties

**"MetaMask not detected"**
- Install MetaMask browser extension from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
- Refresh the page after installation

**Functions not working**
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Read the TODO comments carefully
- Use the validation functions to check progress

### Getting Help

1. **Check the Console**: Press F12 → Console tab for error messages
2. **Read TODO Comments**: Each section has detailed instructions
3. **Use Validation Functions**: Run `validateModule1()` to check progress
4. **Debug Step by Step**: Use `console.log()` to trace your code
